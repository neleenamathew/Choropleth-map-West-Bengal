# Choropleth-map-West-Bengal
Build choropleth map for the state of West Bengal using population metric as the indicator
A choropleth map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the
measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map, such as population density or
per-capita income. For this project we used population density as a metric.
GADM package is used to generate map of India ~ district wise.
Spplot() and rgb() are also used.
The 20 district in WB was mapped and was distinguished according to the population density.
